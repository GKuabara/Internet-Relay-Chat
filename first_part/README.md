# First Part

# Project Description

This part of the project consists in building a communication between a server and an unique client through sockets. Both host and server must be able to send and receive multiple messages in any sequence.

The code can be compiled using any starndad Linux with gcc and make packages through the following commands:

```c
// compile the server and the client
make all
```

To run the code, first run the server, then the client in different terminals:
```c
make run-server
make run-client
```
